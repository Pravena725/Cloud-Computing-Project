# Cloud-Computing-Project
Project based on MicroServices.


Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. 

Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features. 

Docker and Kubernetes are almost synonymous to 'microservices' as they help package and manage the different components of a project/ application, thereby easing up the implementation of a microservices architecture.
